Thursdays is party night at SnowWorld, with music in the ski hal and a DJ.</p>\n<h3>What does it cost ?</h3>\n<p>Dinner will cost the little fee of&nbsp;<strong>32,50 Euro</strong>.

As you can see from the <a title=\"J and Beyond Sponsors\" href=\"http://jandbeyond.org/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=itemlist&amp;layout=category&amp;task=category&amp;id=8&amp;Itemid=10\">current list of sponsors</a>, some of the most recognizable global brands have already taken advantage of this opportunity. Although the Gold sponsorship packages are sold out, Silver and Bronze packages are still available.</p>\n<p>If you feel that a Silver or Bronze sponsorship might be too large a commitment, we also offer affordable stands for commercial Joomla extensions or solution developers. Commercial stands are also a unique way to sponsor J and Beyond as we will match your sponsorship by waiving the fee for a non-commercial stand. Not only will your stand give you an opportunity to interact directly with the community, you will actually be contributing to a cost-free project as well.</p>\n<p>So if you or your company are still considering becoming a sponsor for J and Beyond 2011, now is the time to act: simply <a title=\"Sponsorship Opportunities\" href=\"http://jandbeyond.org/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=itemlist&amp;layout=category&amp;task=category&amp;id=10&amp;Itemid=16\">review the sponsorship packages/stands</a> and send an email to <a href=\"mailto:sponsoring@jandbeyond.org\">sponsoring@jandbeyond.org</a>.</p>\n<p>Don't delay!!</p></div>",

Any and every participant  has the opportunity to present a paper which can be either a presentation, tutorial or workshop. This is your opportunity to not only meet your peers but to share your ideas, experiences and projects.</p>\n<p>Before submitting a paper please spend a moment or two to consider if it is appropriate. If you think it sounds like something you would be interested in attending then thats a good start. A simple product demonstration is probably not the right presentation for J and Beyond, the attendees are more than capable of downloading software and checking it out for themselves. Think <strong>beyond</strong> the obvious and try to propose sessions that will truly inform, educate and engage with the unique audience at J and Beyond.</p>\n\n<h2 />\n</div><div class=\"K2FeedFullText\">\n</span>Some Ideas</h2>\n<h3>Case Studies</h3>\n<p>Have you developed a unique site? Share with the participants at J and Beyond the challenges and difficulties you faced and how you resolved them.</p>\n<h3>Tutorials</h3>\n<p>Have you discovered a new library or perhaps developed an API? Articles and videos can only go so far, there is nothing better than an in-person tutorial to really explain the key concepts</p>\n<h3>Discussions</h3>\n<p>Is there a subject that grabs your attention? Are there multiple possibilities for the best way forward? Why not chair a discussion and together with other participants discuss and debate the options to perhaps reach a consensus.</p>\n<h3>Workshop</h3>\n<p>Sometimes there is nothing better than opening the laptop and getting down to some real code. Share your expertise and experience with your fellow J and Beyond attendees.</p>\n<h3>Working Methodology</h3>\n<p>It may be a business, design or development method that you want to share. Or have you discovered the perfect computer setup that drasticaly reduces your development time leaving you more time for the important stuff in life.</p>\n<h3>New Technology</h3>\n<p>Technology doesn't stand still and neither should we. There are new coding methodologies, javascript libraries and platforms announced all the time. Share your experience and thoughts creating, developing or simply exploring the future.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://jandbeyond.org/information/How-to-buy-a-ticket.html#content\">Tickets</a> for J and Beyond are on sale at only 149 Euros until 1st April.</p></div>",

One of the most important tasks is to recruit sponsors and today we are happy to announce that significant progress has been made in this area. In fact, we have secured the Main sponsor and have sold all of the available Gold sponsorship packages.</p>\n<p>With the Joomla extension development team redWeb.dk the conference has an excellent main sponsor. Based in Denmark, the 22 person team is often recognized as one of the success stories within the community and currently manage an extension club (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://redCOMPONENT.com\">redCOMPONENT.com</a>), a hosting service, and other web-related services centered around Joomla. Their financial support highlights their commitment to the open source community and we are honored to have them as a main sponsor.</p>\n<p>Like redCOMPONENT.com, our other sponsors will be familiar to almost anyone using Joomla.</p>\n</div><div class=\"K2FeedFullText\">\n<p>For example,&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" title=\"JoomlArt\" href=\"http://www.joomlart.com/\">JoomlArt</a> returns to J and Beyond as a Gold sponsor. As one of the most popular template clubs JoomlArt displays a unique intensity and passion for the Joomla project. They also support other open source solutions such as Drupal with their design and template work. Based in Vietnam they are sending a team to the conference to present their new developments and solutions.</p>\n<p>With&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Community Builder\" href=\"http://www.joomlapolis.com/\">Community Builder</a> we have a second returning partner. Last year Beat and Nick joined us as a commercial stand partner and presented their latest developments around the product. This year they decided to increase their support and became a Gold sponsor. Their contribution is specifically dedicated to the video documentation and networking of J and Beyond.</p>\n<p>As Joomla continues to capture a larger share of the market, it is only natural that large corporations and service providers take notice. Many of these companies run Microsoft IIS web servers and the need for Joomla to run smoothly on this platform became readily apparent. Joomla is not the only open source CMS in need of a good integration with several web servers and therefore we and the entire community were excited when Microsoft started an initiative to make it easier to integrate solutions such as Joomla on their platform.</p>\n<p>With the Web Matrix platform installer they created an integrated installation toolkit that makes it simple to get Joomla running on your local computer or a hosting partner. As a Gold Sponsor, we are pleased that&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Microsoft\" href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/web/joomla/\">Microsoft's</a> engagement with the open source community did not stopped with the integration of our solutions but they also support our events to get in touch and learn about our demands, ideas and concepts.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the email service provider&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" title=\"MailChimp\" href=\"http://www.mailchimp.com/\">MailChimp</a> joins us this year as a Gold Sponsor. Numerous Joomla-based businesses and organizations (including J and Beyond) use MailChimp to communicate with their customers and MailChimp has taken notice. All their solutions can be easily integrated with Joomla extensions and we are looking forward to talks related to the integration of MailChimp in Joomla products and services.</p>\n<p>Sponsors are critical to a successful J and Beyond and please join me in once again expressing our gratitude to our generous sponsors. If you or your company is interested in becoming a J and Beyond sponsor, please contact us at&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:sponsoring@jandbeyond.org?subject=JAB11 Sponsorship\">sponsoring@jandbeyond.org</a>.</p></div>",

               "description":"<div class=\"K2FeedIntroText\"><h2>Date and venue confirmed</h2>\n<p>The 2010 J and Beyond conference was a great success for all of us in the Joomla community, both attendees and all the people that watched our videos and information online. With this success in mind we have a clear mandate to organize J and Beyond 2011.</p>\n<p>We are happy to report that the two most important decisions for 2011, the date and location, have been made. J and Beyond will take place on the <strong>6th to 8th of May 2011</strong> at the<a href=\"http://www.rolduc.com\"> Rolduc Conference</a> and Hotel resort in Kerkrade, Netherlands.</p>\n<p>With about 200 attendees on site, the 2010 conference had a very broad spectrum of web developers, designers, solution providers and website integrators who discussed the latest extensions, trends and developments.</p>\n<p>According to our conference feedback, the top three criteria for attendance in 2010 were:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>networking opportunities (36%)</li>\n<li>quality of speakers (33%) </li>\n<li>conference program (24%)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In 2011 we aim to continue and build upon the success of last year but we can only do that with your help. The next stage is to open the \"<strong>Call for Papers</strong>\" to allow everyone the opportunity to shape the conference by proposing sessions/talks that they wish to make.</p>\n<p>We will publish all of the proposals here on the J and Beyond web site and allow the community to discuss and vote those proposals. If you are interested in submitting a proposal we suggest you sign-up to our conference <a href=\"http://eepurl.com/JVVH\">newsletter</a> and follow us on twitter (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/jadbeyond\">jandbeyond</a> or #jab11) as more information about the process will be published soon.</p></div>",

               "description":"<div class=\"K2FeedIntroText\"><p>Yesterday evening we had our second team call for the J and Beyond 2011 conference. It is always great to discuss with people about the event and the feedback we got recently was quite impressive as well as positive.</p>\n<p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?hl=en&formkey=dFUtTWI1VEJfUzJ5b3dlYTlCdGlBUGc6MQ#gid=0\">attendees survey</a> has not been filled out by everyone (yet) but the first indications are  that we met our target audience quite well. Most of the attendees qualified themselves as experts related the Joomla CMS solutions. The CCK sessions attracted most of the attention which might be related to the fact that these extensions are very modern these days.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile all the <a href=\"http://jandbeyond.org/index.php?option=com_k2&view=itemlist&layout=category&task=category&id=30&Itemid=386\">videos</a> from the conference are online and available. Some need some updates due to changes in the blip.tv players. We are working on that and if you come across some problems please do not hesitate to get in touch with us. Many of the videos have already been viewed more than 1.500 times which is also related to the fact that those speakers included the videos on their own websites. We think this is a great idea and we would like to encourage all our speakers to embed your videos on your own website and related channels.  </p>\n<h2>What about J and Beyond 2011?</h2>\n<p>We are still undecided about the final date and location. Several options have been discussed and we are currently reviewing the quotes we have received. The options are quite different in their style. One is a monastery which moves on with the spirit JAB10 started the other one is a conference center in the country side which gives us a quite impressive ambience and good service overcoming some of the technical problems we had. As we expect more people to join the 2011 event we need to balance some more requirements to make it a great event again.</p>\n<p>In order to keep you updated we have created a new email newsletter (using MailChimp) which is <a href=\"http://eepurl.com/JVVH\" target=\"_blank\">open for sign-up now</a>. We are not going to automatically add anybody to this new mailing list so if you are interested please sign-up.</p>\n<p>Last but not least I would like to stress the point that we are still creating this event as a community event and effort. We will move on with this spirit and open more collaborative features such as comments, ratings and others here on our site soon. As it is holiday season in Europe please give us a little (very little) break to prepare these things. In the meantime feel free to get in touch with the team using our <a href=\"http://jandbeyond.org/index.php?option=com_rdbs_form&view=form&id=kontakt&Itemid=8\">contact form</a> at any time.  </p>\n<p> </p></div>",

               "description":"<div class=\"K2FeedIntroText\"><p>Yes its true - we are going to organize J and Beyond 2011!</p>\n<p>The overwhelming feedback and support after the event, your comments during the event and the support of the community are just some of the reasons why we are going to do it again. Last week we had our debrief team meeting and the team was really positive about a new conference.</p>\n<p>As we take things seriously and want to make the organization the best that we can we decided not to rush. So currently we are looking for a suitable date somewhere in the range of March to May 2011. Of course we are taking other important events such as Joomla!Days in Europe into account which is why we are talking to the organizers about their plans at the moment. A second topic is to find a fitting venue. As we expect more people to attend the next J and Beyond, our really cool Wilhelm-Kempf-Haus will exceed its capacities. One decision was made. We will stay in the middle of Europe either Germany or near by. Also having an international airport near by is one of the requirements for the venue. If you have been to a really cool venue let us know, maybe it is an option for us as well.</p>\n<p>So what is next?</p>\n<p>End of July we will have our next team meeting to decide the date and if possible the venue as well. From there the preparations for J and Beyond 2011 will start. There are many new and exicting ideas flowing around and we will definitely discuss them with the community world wide. As soon as we have relaxed a bit we will setup the new areas, groups or such to give you a chance to bring in your ideas, wishes and suggestions.</p>\n<p>For the moment I wish all of you a cool summer holidays (a warm winter holiday for the people below the equator) and see you hopefully next year.</p></div>",
